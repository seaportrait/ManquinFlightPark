<h1>All Pilots</h1>
<p>While the Manquin Flight Park welcomes all certified/current hang glider pilots, the flight park has a responsibility to ensure a safety flying 
environment for guest pilots and members. All pilots including members are solely responsible in maintaining their flight skills.

Pilots will not be allowed to fly at Manquin Flight Park until those deficiencies are resolved.</p>
